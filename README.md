# Doterra

### Some explanation
These pdfs were written by Dr. Susan Lawton. They seem to float across
the internet one domain at a time. Twice have I searched for them and
the domain was taken down.

I have downloaded them using...

```shell
$ mkdir -p ~/Documents/Oils/Information\ Sheets

$ cd ~/Documents/Oils/Information\ Sheets

$ wget http://www.lifeisessential.com/pdf/ --recursive --level=1 --accept '*.pdf' --no-parent --no-directories

$ for f in *.pdf; do mv "$f" "${f/\ Information\ Sheet/}"; done
```
Unfortunately, these are no longer hosted at lifeisessential.com, so 
running these little scripts won't work for you. I just present them 
here with some amount of nerdy pride - hey, we get it where we can.

I have found these documents helpful. Hopefully you will find them to 
be of use as well.

Enjoy!

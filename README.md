### Some explanation
These pdfs were written by Dr. Susan Lawton. They seem to float across
the internet one domain at a time. Twice have I searched for them and
the domain was taken down.

I have downloaded them using...

```shell
$ mkdir -p ~/Documents/Oils/Information\ Sheets

$ cd ~/Documents/Oils/Information\ Sheets

$ wget http://www.lifeisessential.com/pdf/ --recursive --level=1 --accept '*.pdf' --no-parent --no-directories

$ for f in *.pdf; do mv "$f" "${f/\ Information\ Sheet/}"; done
```
if you want the satisfaction of using these little scripts, feel free.

I've found these documents helpful. Hopefully they are of use to you.
Enjoy!
